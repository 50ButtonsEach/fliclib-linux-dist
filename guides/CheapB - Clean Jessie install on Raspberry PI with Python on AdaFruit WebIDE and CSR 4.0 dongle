Header says it all.. A couple of notes before we begin: 
1) I am not an expert by any means, so feel free to comment or improve as you see fit
2) Do not attach your BT dongle before the instructions call for it.

3) It would be great if anyone have info on blueZ binaries pre-complied for RPI/Jessie. It is pretty painful to compile every time there is an update

Lets get started:

Download jessie (https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2015-05-07/2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.zip) and install (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md)

Configure network connection etc - what you normally will do or google it. Do NOT attach your BT dongle yet! :-)

Install Putty or similar on your regular PC for SSH access to the RPI

via SSH or on the CLI:

update all system packages:
sudo apt-get update

update all installed packages:
sudo apt-get upgrade

this will take a while
optional: clean out installation files:
sudo apt-get clean

install Adafruit WebIDE (https://learn.adafruit.com/webide/installation)

Backup your SD card with Win32DiskImager (for windows) or similar if you are on a different platform. This will save you a lot of time if you want a clean install when the next beta is out

install needed packages for blueZ:

sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
sudo apt-get install automake
sudo apt-get install libtool
sudo apt-get install libical-dev
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

Install BlueZ:
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git

cd bluez

./bootstrap

this will take a while
./configure --enable-experimental --enable-library

this will take a while
make

time for coffee
sudo make install

sudo shutdown -h now

Insert the BT dongle and restart

login

cd bluez/src

sudo ./bluetoothd -nEd

This should be kept active

Open a new SSH session
mkdir flic
cd flic

sudo wget https://github.com/50ButtonsEach/fliclib-linux-dist/releases/download/1-beta3/fliclib-linux.tar.gz

This will change based on the release - go and grab the newest link from the release page https://github.com/50ButtonsEach/fliclib-linux-dist/releases
sudo tar -zxvf fliclib-linux.tar.gz

Check your architecture with uname -m and cd into the corresponding directory.

sudo ./daemon -l -f flic.sqlite3

This should be kept active

Open a new SSH session

cd flic/armv6l/fliclib-cpp

sudo hciconfig hci0 up

./flic

If this is the first time you connect your Flic, do the following:

startScan
press your button and wait for button discovered message
stopScan

If you already have connected your Flic, it should show up if you enter:

list 

press and hold the button for 8 sec and then enter

connect __MAC__

This may take a few tries as my button never glows in public mode. You know it was successfull when is says connected and start track button presses..

exit flic with ctrl-C

install Flic Python lib:

cd ~/flic/armv6l/fliclib-cpp/ffi/python/flic/dist 
sudo easy_install flic-0.1-py2.7.egg

Test:
start your AdaFruit WebIDE

create a new python file

copy and paste the attached test into your file and execute
main.txt

Test by pressing the button

Have fun!
